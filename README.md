# Apache_Kafka

<p>My first exploration of Apache Kafka: Sending newly created events in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a> as a stream via <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> to <a href="https://rockset.com/">Rockset</a>.</p>
<p>I had to refrain from a planned further visual exploration due to the withdrawal of <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> and Apache Kafka from their cooperation.</p>
